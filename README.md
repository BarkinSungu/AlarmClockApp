# Alarm Clock App

The Alarm Clock App is designed to provide a simple and effective way to set alarms and manage alarm sounds. Whether the app is running or closed, it ensures that your alarms go off as intended.

## Features

- Set alarms to wake you up or remind you of important events.
- Alarms will ring even if the app is closed, ensuring you never miss an important moment.
- Customize your alarm sound by choosing from a variety of pre-installed sounds within the app.
- If your device supports it, you can also set your own sound from the audio library as your alarm tone.

## Note about Notifications

Please note that notifications work on the iOS simulator as well, allowing you to experience the app's alarm and notification features even when using a virtual device.

However, for the best experience, it's recommended to test the app on a physical iOS device to fully observe the alarm sounds and notification behavior.
